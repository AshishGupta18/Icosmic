                An idiosyncratic hackathon (online + hackathon) that focuses on the development of soft skills along with core coding skills.The evaluation criteria is divided into 3 stages. All the participants are supposed to choose a problem statement revolving around current affairs in different disciplines in order to develop a technically achievable solution (in the form of web apps , websites , android apps , etc.).

The participants have to come prepared with a proposal speech of their product . The pitch must contain the problem statement , solution approach , revenue model (if any), UI screenshots , Features & USP in a ppt.The pitch shall be presented in front of a bench of highly experienced industrial experts/influencers for evaluation.

The participants will then provide a documented prototype of their idea through Project workflow , use case diagrams , activity diagram and user stories.

The remaining time of the hackathon shall be dedicated to the development of the proposed project until the final evaluation. All the participants shall be provided with refreshments periodically , they will also have access to all the food stalls in BU. All the participants shall be provided with yoga mats , neck pillows , bean bags,extension cords and unlimited coffee , for their convenience.

                A workshop to show the roadmap to cracking MAANG companies and to convey insights on current industrial trends in the Computer Science department for summarizing the vast topic of  CS & IT , as a career. Following the vibe , the event shall comprise of a coding contest : further divided into 4 rounds , each dedicated to polish a characteristic that a coder must embrace. Round 1 shall check the coding ability & logic as the participants must solve a problem statement in the shortest possible way through a code in their desired language . Round 2 is more inclined towards checking the versatility of the coder.Each participant shall be assigned a code , they will have to translate it to another language (from the given options). Round 3 will be used to check the speed & accuracy of the participant.A problem statement shall publicly be shared and each coder will have to code it in the minimum possible time. They should hit the buzzer as soon as they finish the code.Please note that some of the test cases would be hidden and use of any search engine/browser shall not be permitted. Round 4 will test the UI designs of the students.The participants shall be provided with a riddle , which will contain a hidden problem statement and user stories.The participants are needed to come up with the most relevant non coded UI design for the same.Please note that Round 4 is not an eliminating round. The final evaluation shall be done by a bench of highly experienced individuals in the field of Full Stack  web development.

                <b>ROUND 2 :</b><br /><br />
                This round's goal is to assess students' versatility and compatibility with using different programming languages in visual paradigms. Participants will be paired up and given a problem with the target language mentioned. As soon as the first team member finds the solution, their partner receives their code but not the test case or problem statement. The teammate will now need to convert the coding language into a different language (will be mentioned to the participant separately). The output of the original code and the modified code must be the same for all the test cases. Participants are free to choose the task they want to perform. Scores are to be displayed on the leaderboard.

                From portable rockets to mega projects- we all witnessed some astonishing space discoveries but also encountered some faults. Space research is a wide research field that will surely continue to surprise down the line of time and space. Let us together explore the unexplored in every dimension possible.
MOM , an event dedicated to outer space research that encourages students to think “ Out of the Globe”.It shall begin with an interactive workshop by ISRO and DRDO on insights of  research internships , working culture in scientific government organizations and science behind the most successful space projects.
All the tracks regarding the same , have been uploaded on the website. Participants need to pick one among the six options and develop a presentation to present the same in front of a highly educated bench of scientists from ISRO and DRDO after submitting their research paper on a submission form(only to be shared with the registered participants). The participants will also be provided with a failed space project. They shall formulate their own prototype of their contribution , if they had been an engineer in the same project.
The judgment bench shall score the participants on various criterias , including pitch , logic , scientific relevance , conclusion & theory.

                Q. What is Clash Of Codes?<br />
                A.  This is a one-of-a-kind event, which will take place in Two Phases. The first phase will weed out the rest and only leave the very best. Everyone will have to solve a given set of questions. The ones who got the most correct in the least time will proceed. The final phase will put you head-to-head in a fast-paced duel, which will leave only one winner at the end. Do you have what it takes?
